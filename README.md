=================

<a href='https://embed-responsively.com/'>Embed Responsively</a> helps web content producers transform fixed width embedded content into fluid responsive embeds.

The code here is based on research and work by <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/creating-intrinsic-ratios-for-video">Theirry Koblentz</a>, <a href="http://amobil.se/2011/11/responsive-embeds/">Anders Andersen</a> and <a href="http://niklausgerber.com/blog/responsive-google-or-bing-maps/">Niklaus Gerber</a>. The original Embed Responsively tool was built by <a href="https://github.com/jeffehobbs/embedresponsively/">Jeffe Hobbs</a> and has been an amazing resource for a long time, but it doesn't look to be actively maintained any more.
